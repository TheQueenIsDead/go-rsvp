# go-rsvp

This is a simple webapp written with the following technologies:
 - [Go](https://go.dev/)
 - [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/)
 - [HTMX](https://htmx.org/)
 - [Moustache](https://mustache.github.io/)

It aims to use the [HAL-FORMS](http://rwcbook.github.io/hal-forms/#_code_method_code) media type (`application/prs.hal-forms+json`)
which is built on [HAL](https://stateless.group/hal_specification.html), specifically [HAL+JSON](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-kelly-json-hal#section-8)
(`application/hal+json`)
